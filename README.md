> _Hermes is an Olympian god in Greek religion and mythology. Moving freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine,
 he is portrayed as emissary and the messenger of the gods._

`Hermes` is a lightweight, header-only, cross-platform (not yet), thread-safe, asynchronous, `C++11` network library with no dependencies.

## Requirement

- C++11 only.

## Usage

Hermes is a header only library, you just need to include the `Hermes.hpp` header, to use the `library`.

 - Download Hermes:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TommyStarK/Hermes.git
```

- Run tests:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

## Documentation

A [Full documentation](https://github.com/TommyStarK/Hermes/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) is available.


## Contribution

Each Contribution is welcomed and encouraged. I do not claim to cover each use cases nor completely master the C++. If you encounter a non sense or
any trouble, you can open an issue and I will be happy to discuss about it.
